Get data about Brazillian Health Insurance Companies.

This was a quick script created to help me understand some caracteristics of this market.

I'm not proud of it, is not something ready to use, but maybe can help you to get and organize public data about this insurances.

The scripts use two sources:

1 - ANS public data about the companies. Example: http://www.ans.gov.br/qualificacao_consumidor/informacoes_operadora.asp?co_operadora_param=326305

2 - Receita Federal CNPJs public data from https://www.receitaws.com.br
